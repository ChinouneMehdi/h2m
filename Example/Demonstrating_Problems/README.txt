The files in this folder address some of the more
common problems likely to be encountered during
translation.
The Tests subdirectory included with h2m tests
a wider variety of features and reveals a wider
variety of problems including those with array
translations, unions, structure initializaitons,
and macros.
The Tests subdirectory, however, does not include
detailed notes with the demonstrations.
Run h2m on these files, read the comments in the
files, and observe the output and errors to
learn about the demonstrated limitations.
